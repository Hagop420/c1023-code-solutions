## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the `&&` (logical AND) and `||` (logical OR) operators and how can they be used outside of `if` statements?
&& checks if both of the elements meet a certain condition

|| checks if 1 of tghe values/statments meet a specific condition

- What is "short-circuit evaluation" and how does it apply to `&&` and `||`?
- In short-circuit evaluation, an expression with logical operators ( || and && ) is evaluated from left to right
- What is the `??` (nullish coalescing) operator and how does it differ from `||`?
- it is an alternative to || that will only return the right-side expression if the left-side is null or undefined
- What is the `?:` (ternary) operator? How does it differ from `if/else`?
- A ternary operator is a single statement, while an if-else is a block of code
- What is the `?.` (optional chaining) operator? When would you use it?
- its a shorthand wuay of writing out an if statment
- What is `...` (spread) syntax? How do you use it with arrays and objects?
- Spread syntax can be used when all elements from an object or array need to be included in a new array or object, or should be applied one-by-one in a function call's arguments list
- What data types can be spread into an array? Into an object?
- Numbers
- strings
-objects
- decimals
