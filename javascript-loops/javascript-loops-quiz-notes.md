## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  -repeat the same or incrementation block of code
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  -checks if the code testing function in the if statment is true or false if so it loops through the results.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  -iteration is a loop
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  -it gets evaluated when it fires the first result and it evaluates to false for example here

const i = 10
while(i<10){
return i
}
After it logs 1 itll log 2 because the condition isnt met because 1 is not greater then 10 so itll go till it stops at 9

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  -when the first output evaluates to false then it moves on to the next loop until the condition is no longer true.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  -when the testing condition is no longer met
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  -it adds it by 1
  --subtracts
  \*=multiplies
  /=divides
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  for(let key in pair){
  console.log(key)
  }
