- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
-In web design/development a meia query breakpoint is defined as a point where the default screen reaches and hits a certain width or screen height position
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
-Using a % instead of a width for anything flexbox might and is helpful because of it's capability to move along with the page and have more text and content responsiveness rather then having a fixed position like a px which wownt move along with the page
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
